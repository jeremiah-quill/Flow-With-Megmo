						Hi! I'm Megmo, but you probably knew that &#9996;. I grew up a
						competitive dancer and have always made fitness an important part of
						my life. In 2017 I found yoga sculpt as a practice and it was love
						at first sight. I was completely obsessed with the way it
						incorporated strength & breath (thru yoga) and power & toning (thru
						sculpt). For me, it's a full body, full mind workout and I always
						leave my mat feeling energized and accomplished. <br></br>
						<br></br>In 2018 I completed Yoga Sculpt teacher training through
						Corepower Yoga in Boston and began teaching in 2019. From the mat in
						the back, to front & center, I quickly realized leading this
						practice was my passion. This is where I feel at home. <br></br>
						<br></br>Between a pandemic, a baby, and lots of life in between, I
						stepped away from teaching in the studio. I started this platform to
						reconnect with my passion of guiding students through this practice
						in a larger way. Near or far, yogis are welcome to spend 1 hr with
						me, sweating & striving towards something bigger than themselves.
						<br></br><br></br>Namaste
